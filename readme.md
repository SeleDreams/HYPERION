# HYPERION UTAU

This is the repository of the French UTAU HYPERION.

This is an experimental voicebank derived from the voice of SeleDreams.

This voicebank is released as-is but is not finished. The icon design is not final and the oto is flawed. feel free to push pull requests if you find issues to fix.

# Installing

To install this voicebank, you will need to have git with git lfs installed. 

Then, you just need to do the command `git clone git@github.com:SeleDreams/HYPERION.git`

If for some reason, the wav files didn't get properly downloaded and you get some text files instead, make sure to run inside the HYPERION directory the command `git lfs pull` (if lfs pull fails, makes sure you properly have git lfs working on your computer.)
